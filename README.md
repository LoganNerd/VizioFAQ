# VizioFAQ
I applied for a job as a software developer intern at Vizio and hadn't heard back for a few weeks so I went into their applicant FAQ  page and found an HTML page in need of some work, so I copied the code into VS code and tried to make it look a little better :)

Original Page: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26885024/215279216-a0d578b3-4d36-42e3-9fc9-2740782a8be0.png)

Edited Page: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26885024/215279261-1836de02-bc5f-4f26-a6c6-927f987fae58.png)

One of the biggest things I noticed that I wanted to change immediately was the link to the top of the page after every. single. question. This was easily resolved with a single "Back to Top" button anchored to the bottom right of the screen.

I also found that the boring white page with no indication that it is related to Vizio at all was kind of a bummer to look at. So I found a cool background on google and changed the color of the text to stand out on the screen. Now you have a futuristic, modern style FAQ page that is a little bit more exciting to read through!
