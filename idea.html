<h2>I forgot my password. Can I retrieve or reset it? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>Yes, if you forgot your password, you can easily reset it. Just click <strong>Log back in!</strong> at the top right corner of any page on the career site. You'll be directed to the Login page, where you'll see a link for <strong>Forgot your password?</strong>. Click that link, enter your email address, and then check your email for directions to reset your password.</p><p>If you’d like a detailed walk-through, please watch the password reset learning clip below.</p>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="logging-in-search">
<h2>Do I need to log in to search for and review jobs? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>No, you don't typically need to log in to review jobs on a career site (although certain organizations may require it). A login is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> required when applying for jobs on a career site.
</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="logging-in-apply">
<h2>Can I apply for a job as a guest without logging in? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>No, you must have your own online profile in the system to complete a job application. When logged in to your profile, you can apply to multiple jobs listed on the organization's career site.
</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="logging-in-already">
<h2>I might already have an online profile. How would I know? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>On many organizations' career sites, if you already have an online profile, you'll find out upon starting your job application:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you DO have a profile, the system will confirm this once you enter your email address. Depending on the setup of the career site, you'll either be directed to the Login page—meaning you have a profile to log in to—or you'll be alerted via error message that your email is already attached to a profile. (The system does not allow multiple profiles with the same email address.)</li>
    <li>If you DO NOT have a profile, you'll immediately be directed to build a new profile after entering your email address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can always contact the organization directly to ask if you have a profile or not.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Note: </strong> Your online profile can only be associated with one email address. If you're unsure if you have an online profile and regularly use more than one email, you may wish to enter multiple addresses on the career site to see if any are attached to an existing profile. Please do not create additional profiles for yourself with different email addresses.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-create">
<h2>How do I start creating my online profile? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>If you're a new applicant, you can create an online profile by clicking <strong>Apply for this job online</strong> on any listed job and following the steps presented to you.</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> Some organizations will allow you to create a profile without applying to a specific job. For more information, review the <a href="#general-consideration">Can I submit my resume for general consideration, rather than applying to a specific job</a> section of this page.</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-email">
<h2>After clicking the Apply button, why am I asked to enter my email address? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>If you're not logged in, you may be taken to an Enter Your Email page after clicking <strong>Apply for this job online</strong>. By inputting your email address, the system will identify whether you're a new applicant or a returning applicant with an existing profile. It will then direct you to the logical next step in your application.</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-submit">
<h2>When creating a profile, how should I submit my resume or personal information? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>You can submit your information in a few different ways. The options available to you may vary depending on how the organization's career site is set up. Options may include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Uploading your resume (through your computer or through a cloud storage site like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Microsoft OneDrive), which allows the career site to parse your resume and fill in appropriate fields.</li>
    <li>Filling out an online form, which allows you to enter your information into each field manually.</li>
</ol>
<p>Available options will be presented to you on the Basic Information page of your application. The information you choose to include will become part of your online profile in the system.</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-access">
<h2>How do I access my profile if I created it through a social account? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>To access your profile, log in to the career site of the organization you are applying to. After clicking Log back in! at the top right corner, you may see login buttons for up to four social sites (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft).</p>
<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> In certain circumstances, you'll also be able to access your social login after clicking the <strong>Apply for this job online</strong> button on a job.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-status">
<h2>How can I check my status for a job I've applied to? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>You can check your status by logging in to your profile and reviewing your candidate dashboard. The dashboard will display all positions you've applied to, along with the status of each one.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about your job status, you can always contact the organization you have applied to.</p>
</div>
<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile-complete">
<h2>I didn't finish my application. How can I complete it? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>You can do this through the candidate dashboard in your online profile. In the Actions column, you'll see a <strong>Continue Application</strong> button next to all jobs in which you have an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incomplete</span> application. Clicking this button allows you to continue your application from where you left off.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
  <ul><li>Also in the Actions column, you may see a <strong>Withdraw</strong> button next to jobs for which you have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completed</span> application. You can click this button to remove your name from consideration for the job.</li>
    <li>Depending on how the career site is set up, the Actions column and buttons within that column may be labeled differently or may not be available at all.</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="profile_information">
<h2>How can I update the information in my online profile (including my resume)? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>You can update your information by logging in to your existing profile and clicking the <strong>Update your profile</strong> button. This will bring up your profile page, where you can make updates to your personal information and/or resume. When finished, simply click <strong>Update Profile</strong> at the bottom.</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="formatting-resume">
<h2>Are there any formatting best practices for resumes to be parsed successfully? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>For successful parsing of your resume, it is recommended that you put your name and contact information within the body of your resume (rather than within the header or footer of the document). Additionally, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> recommended to put important text within tables, text boxes/shapes, images, or annotations.</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="general-consideration">
<h2>Can I submit my resume for general consideration, rather than applying to a specific job? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>Some organizations allow candidates to submit their resume for general consideration without applying to a specific position. This places your resume into the organization's recruiting system. </p>

<p>If the organization allows this, you will see a <strong>Connect with us</strong> or <strong>Submit your resume</strong> link on its career site, typically on the Welcome page. (If neither link is available, you must apply for a specific open position and follow the normal application steps.)</p>
</div>

<div class="tb section-heading" id="search">
<h2>How can I search for a job on the career site? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="pad-bottom">
  <p>There are various ways to search for a job on the career site:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Keyword search:</strong> A keyword search is used primarily for searching the title and description of a job.    
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Advanced search:</strong> Additional filters may be available to allow you to narrow down your search even further. If available, you can use any or all of these filters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Category</li>
        <li>Company</li>
        <li>Posted Date</li>
        <li>Position Type</li>
        <li>Telecommute</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you choose to use more than one filter, your results will meet all of the criteria selected.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>


<div class="tb section-heading" id="managing-updates">
<h2>I'm interested in receiving general job updates and other notifications from the organization. How can I do this? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>On some career sites, you can sign up for email updates based on your general areas of interest. If the organization allows you to submit your resume for general consideration, its career site may have a section on the Welcome page labeled <strong>Connect with us</strong> (or something similar). By clicking the Connect with us link, entering your email address, and then selecting your interests, you may also be offered the option to set up general company emails.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> The content and frequency of these general emails will depend on the organization.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="tb section-heading" id="managing-spam">
<h2>Is there anything I can do to prevent an organization's emails from going to my spam/junk folder? <span><span class="screen-reader">Move to </span></a></span></h2>
</div>

<div class="pad-bottom">
<p>Many email providers have increasingly stringent spam filters that can trap legitimate emails. This often includes emails sent automatically, such as job application confirmations or company newsletters; it can also include emails sent to you personally, such as interview invitations.</p>
<p>If you notice that emails from organizations you have connected with or applied to are going to your spam folder, you may need to adjust your spam filters.</p>
<p>The terminology and steps to take these actions will depend on your email provider, but the idea is generally the same—you need to find the email in your spam folder and indicate that either the message or its sender is not spam.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Each organization uses a company-specific email address to send out emails and notifications. If you've applied to multiple organizations that use iCIMS software, you may need to whitelist (or add to your approved sender list) the email address used for each organization. If you're unsure what that email address is, you can reach out to your point of contact at the organization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are a few links to help you prevent and manage spam from some of the most common email providers:</p>
